Tutorial 01 - Introduction
==========================

In this tutorial I will give an example of going through all the steps required
to get up and running with BitPay using the PHP SDK with code examples.

The code that you find here SHOULD run needing only to modify a few values. If
you run into trouble or if the code becomes out of date and does not run, please
bring it to our attention by opening a GitHub issue.

To begin, please visit https://test.bitpay.com and register for a test account.
This will allow you to use BitPay using Bitcoin's testnet feature. If you are
looking for a testnet wallet to test with, please visit https://copay.io and
create a new wallet. When you first create your wallet, under the Advanced
Options, you are given to option to make the wallet a testnet wallet.

Once you have an account and a testnet wallet, you should begin to go through
this tutorial starting from file `001.php` and continuing on to the next
files in order.
